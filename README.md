# ICO-Transparency-Monitor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Neufund/ico-transparency-monitor.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Neufund/ico-transparency-monitor) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/Neufund/generic-ico.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

## Adding custom ICOs to the Transparency-Monitor
The ICO-monitor collects information from the blockchain public-ledger using a set of pre-defined
rules set in [config.js](https://github.com/Neufund/ico-transparency-monitor/blob/master/src/config.js)

To add your own ICO you would have to

1. Include the ICO Smart-Contract [ABI](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI) in the [Smart_Contracts](https://github.com/Neufund/ico-transparency-monitor/tree/master/src/smart_contracts) folder
    this ABI is generated from the smart-contract source code and can be found in some cases in [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)

2. Configure [config.js](https://github.com/Neufund/ico-transparency-monitor/blob/master/src/config.js)
  and add the required information from the smart contract manually. This will require some JavaScript modifications.

  ### Example
  An example of a smart contract configuration

    '#ADDRES-OF-CONTRACT': {
     tokenContract:#ADDRESS-OF-TOKEN-CONTRACT,
      information: {
        aliasName: "NAME-OF-ICO",
        website: "WEBSITE-OF-ICO",
        logo: 'ICO-LOGO'
      },
      event: {
        args: {
          tokens: 'TOKEN-VARIABLE',
          sender: 'INVESTOR-VARIABLE',
        },
        name: 'ICO-EVENT-NAME',
        customArgs: {
          _from: 'FROM-ADDRESS'
        },
        firstTransactionBlockNumber: FIRST-BLOCK
        lastTransactionBlockNumber: LAST-BLOCK
      },
      icoParameters: {
        cap: {
          CODE-TO-GENERATE-CAP
        },
        startDate: {
          CODE-TO-GENERATE-STARTDATE
        },
        endDate: {
          CODE-TO-GENERATE-ENDDATE
        },
      status: CODE-TO-GET-CONTRACT-STATUS,
      },
      matrix: {
        q1: { answer: true, comment: '' },
        q2: { answer: true, comment: '' },
        q3: { answer: false, comment: 'Source code is not exists' },
        q4: { answer: true, comment: '' },
        q5: { answer: true, comment: '' },
        q6: { answer: true, comment: '' },
        q7: { answer: null, comment: '' },
        q8: { answer: true, comment: '' },
        q9: { answer: false, comment: '' },
        q10: { answer: true, comment: '' },
        q11: { answer: true, comment: '' },
        q12: { answer: true, comment: '' },
        q13: { answer: true, comment: '' },
        q14: { answer: true, comment: '' },
      }
    }

  `ADDRESS-OF-CONTRACT` : Ethereum address that points to the ICO-Smart-Contract

  `tokenContract` (Optional) : In some cases a dedicated token smart contract is responsible
  for token issuing and release, if that was the case its address should me provided here

  `aliasName`: Usually should represent the name of the ICO or its alias

  `website`: A link that points to the ICO website

  `logo`: A link that points to the ICO logo

  `tokens`: Name of Variable that represents a token in some cases `Amount, Transfer, _amount` This
  can be taken from the smart-contract source or [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)

  `sender`: Variable name that holds the address of the receiver of tokens or the Investor

  `name`: Name of event generated by the smart-contract and logged in the etherium ledger sometimes `Transfer, TokensBought, CreatedToken`. Without the correct event flag
  it is impossible to track token issue events

  `_from`: In some cases smart-contracts include From addresses that are generated in the public blockchain ledger, if
  that was case for your smart contract you will have to include it here

  `firstTransactionBlockNumber`: Starting block number of the ICO in the public eth ledger can be taken from [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)

  `lastTransactionBlockNumber`: Final Block of the ICO in the public eth ledger can be taken from [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)

  `icoParameters`: Javascript code must be inserted here to get the final parameters, (`cap, startDate, endDate`), every variable should be returned after conducting the needed requests and calculations from the smart-contract. This must
  be written manually for every ICO due to the lack of standards, every smart-contract handles generating a these parameters differently
  for more information on how to write manual code, look at the already available contracts in [config.js](https://github.com/Neufund/ico-transparency-monitor/blob/master/src/config.js)


#### Note
Not all smart contracts provide the needed information, some use different smart-contracts to generate tokens, some have an obscure processes, some have no source code, and some only used a smart-contract after the end of
an ICO

## Getting started

### Setting up your development environment

I recommend and Ubuntu machine with Chrome and Atom. You can use whatever you want.

Install [Chrome][chrome] and the extensions [React Developer Tools][react-ext] and [Redux DecTools][redux-ext].

[chrome]: https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/features.html?brand=CHBD&gclid=CO2x8Ibw5NMCFYoQ0wodulgAlQ&dclid=CO7Tmofw5NMCFUakUQodVc8BvA
[react-ext]: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en
[redux-ext]: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en

#### Atom
Install [Atom][atom] and run the command bellow to install a bunch of packages. Afterwards, configure the eslint plugin to ‘fix on save’.

```
apm install editorconfig file-icons language-diff language-ini language-markdown linter linter-eslint linter-solidity linter-sass-lint linter-write-good minimap minimap-git-diff minimap-highlight-selected
```

[atom]: https://atom.io/

#### Webstorm
Enable editorconfig plugin - [JetBrains manual](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/2017.1/configuring-code-style.html#editorconfig)
Enable ESLint plugin - [JetBrains manual](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/2017.1/eslint.html)
Note that at this time (WebStorm 2017.1.3) you cannot set formatting rules to use one's from ```.eslintrc.json```
([issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-19350)). So you cannot use "Reformat Code" function but you can use plugin
integration. If you see ESLint error you can hit "alt-enter" and choose "ESLint: fix current file". Another option would be to manually edit IDE's javascript codestyle settings.

### Getting up and running

Open the project folder in Atom. Then in a terminal, download all the dependencies:

```
yarn
```


#### Possible `node-sass` issues

For some node / npm versions there is slight problem with `node-sass`. You need to recompile it for your node version after issuing `yarn`.
```
npm rebuild node-sass
```

For now we are using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to run project:

```
yarn start

```
